# vue-d3-streamgraph
This repository shows two different ways of integrating D3.js into Vue - a D3-oriented as well as a Vue-oriented method.
It implements an interactive streamgraph in those two ways.

This project was developed as part of my bachelor thesis and is my first ever public repository, so be warned.
